# SGAM Advanced
Very basic GUI for GAM advanced that allows manipulation of users, groups, ous, and devices. Runs on windows 7/10, needs .net 4.5, and a current installation of GAMADV-XTD3.

Needs to be run on administrator account.

Poorly written in .net, but you can't beat the price.

Not ready for production.

Version 1.04
